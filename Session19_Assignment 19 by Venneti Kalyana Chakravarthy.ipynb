    "Answer 2: The standard approach to supervised learning is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the Datasets based on the problem statement & clean the dataset by data mangling methods (if exists any Nan or None values).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply the principles of feature engineering (extraction, selection & splitting the data into training and test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Determine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector,which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to accurately predict the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Gather of a training set. The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function which has defined outputs. Thus, a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered, either from human experts or from measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. For example, the engineer may choose to use support vector machines or decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Complete the design: Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters. These parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a validation set) of the training set, or via cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Evaluate the accuracy of the learned function: After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set."

    "\n",
    "Training set:\n",
    "In machine learning, a training set is a dataset used to train a model. In training the model, specific  features are picked out from the training set. These features are then incorporated into the model.  Thereby, if the training set is labeled correctly, the model should be able to learn something from these features.\n",

    "Answer 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "The general principle of an ensemble method is to combine the predictions of several models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve robustness over a single model.  Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into   one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking)\n",
    "\n",
    "And also Bagging and Boosting are similar in that they are both ensemble techniques, where a set of weak learners are combined to create a strong learner that obtains better performance."

    "We can avoid overfitting by following below best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross-validation : Use initial training data to generate multiple mini train-test splits.Use these splits to tune the model.\n",
    "2. Train with more data \n",
    "3. Remove features\n",
    "4. Early stopping : Early stopping refers stopping the training process before the learner passes that point.\n",
    "5. Regularization : Regularization refers to a broad range of techniques for artificially forcing the model to be simpler.\n",
